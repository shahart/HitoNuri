Enjoy Hitori and Nurikabe - with 17 predefined puzzles (from time to time I'll enrich it). 

As I didn't found a small PRC for these puzzles (except using 3 PRCs for total size of 926 KB), I decided to do it by myself, using Jump2 for Java.

For info about the rules, please refer to Wikipedia: Hitori or Nurikabe.

Features:

- The problematic squares will be in red, so you'll focus on solving the puzzle.
- Current puzzle is in the "hitoNuri" Memo. you can edit it.
  (but don't use the Solve button ":(" if you change completely this Memo)
- detect when you solve it :)

Source code is attached.
