 * Socket is a TCP/IP network socket.

 * constructor may hang for an extended period of time due to the
 * implementation of sockets in the underlying OS. This is a known
 * problem.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example showing data being written and read from a socket:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Socket socket = new Socket("www.yahoo.com", 80);
 * if (!socket.isOpen())
 *   return;
 * byte buf[] = new byte[10];
 * buf[0] = 3;
 * buf[1] = 7;
 * socket.writeBytes(buf, 0, 2);
 * int count = socket.readBytes(buf, 0, 10);
 * if (count == 10)
 *   ...
 * socket.close();
 * </pre>
